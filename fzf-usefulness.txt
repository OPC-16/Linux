fzf -> a terminal fuzzy finder
it outputs the path of the selected file to standard output

fzf used in .zshrc as following:

es () { du -a ~/Scripts/* | awk '{print $2}' | fzf | xargs -r $EDITOR }
ec () { du -a ~/Opc/C++\ Programming/* | awk '{$1=""; print $0}' | fzf | xargs -r -I % $EDITOR % }

meaning -
du -a -> du is disk usage, it prints all (-a) files in that dir with their sizes
awk '{print $2}' -> awk prints the contents, here it only prints the 2nd element
awk '{$1=""; print $0}' -> it prints all elements except 1st
fzf -> it takes input of awk and fuzzy finds the file
xargs -> it takes std input and makes it executable, here it opens the file in $EDITOR i.e. nvim
