1) to record the single screen without audio:
	*	ffmpeg -f x11grab -s 1440x900 -i :0.0 out.mkv
 this will take the default screen

2) in multi-monitor -> also mention position of screen which show in output of {xrandr} command
	*	ffmpeg -f x11grab -s 1440x900 -i :0.0+1920,0 out.mkv

3) to record with audio (with alsa):
	*	ffmpeg -f x11grab -s 1440x900 -i :0.0 -f alsa -i hw:1 out.mkv    (don't know why but this doesn't work on this pc)
	*	ffmpeg -f x11grab -s 1440x900 -i :0.0 -f alsa -i default out.mkv 	(this works but the audio is low in loudness)
 hw:1 is hardware no. 1 i.e. it is card number of that output
 card number can be found out by {arecord -l} command....it gives list of all hardware audio devices like mic and speaker

4) to record with audio (with pulseaudio):
   * ffmpeg -f x11grab -s 1440x900 -i :0.0 -f pulse -ac 1 -i 0 out.mkv
   * ffmpeg -video_size 1440x900 -framerate 25 -f x11grab -i :0.0 -f pulse -ac 2 -i 0 out.mkv

	Explanation to options -
-f -> use to take any hardware input like screen, mic, speaker
x11grab -> command to take the screen as video input
alsa -> command to audio as input
-s -> screen resolution
-i -> to take command-line arguments
out.mkv is just the file name that we want to record in

NOTE -> on Artix, the video is flickering (reason not known)
