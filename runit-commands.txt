Runit is an init system used in Artix Linux 
website -> https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Runit

Whenever we download a package its service file is put in /etc/runit/sv/<service_name>
   sometimes we have to install that package's service file manually - eg after installing jenkins, we also have to install jenkins-runit

To start a service we have to create a symlink between service's default dir and following
   sudo ln -s /etc/runit/sv/<service_name> /run/runit/service/

now this service can easily be manipilated by the 'sv' command

sudo sv <start/stop/restart/status> <service_name>

To remove a service
   sudo rm /run/runit/service/<service_name>
