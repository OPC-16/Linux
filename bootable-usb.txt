Create a bootable usb using the 'dd' command

step 1 -
   to find the usb name (like /dev/sdb), use command -> 'lsblk'

step 2 -
   unmount the usb using umount, if automatically mounted -> 'sudo umount /dev/sdb'   (put the proper usb name)

step 3 -
   make it bootable with -> 'sudo dd bs=4M if=/path/to/iso of=/dev/sdb status=progress oflag=sync'
   (be absolutely sure before running this command, check proper device, because all data on that device will be destroyed, thats why 
   people sometimes call 'dd' disk destroyer)
