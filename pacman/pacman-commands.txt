-------------- pacman configurations ----------------------------------

3) to have nice loading bar - 'ILoveCandy'

-------------- problem with pacman -------------------------------------
1) failed to synchronize the databases - remove the db.lck file from /var/lib/pacman

-------------- Fix Your Hipster Distro ----------------------------------
1. a program depends on some shared library of another program, when we upgrade our system and if that program is looking for older version of that shared lib, then we can downgrade that lib's program with -
      'sudo pacman -U /var/cache/pacman/pkg/<specific_tar_file_of_prgram_to_downgrade_to>'
2. but again running pacman with -Syy it will upgrade that package, so to persist the downgrade, edit the /etc/pacman.conf file and look for 'IgnorePkg' line and add the name of downgraded package there
3. but downgrading is not always good, and such problems mainly occur with AUR packages
so easy solution is to recompile them using -
   'yay -S <package_name>' (remember to press 'A' for clean build)
