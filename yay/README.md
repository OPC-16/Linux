## yay ðŸ™Œ

If you use Arch or Arch-based linux distro, you may have come across the term 'AUR'. It stands for Arch User Repository.

It is a place where all users like you and me put the softwares for other users to use them.

Building a package from source is really a pain, so there are AUR helpers like yay which make this laborious process easy.

Yay stands for 'Yet Another Yogurt', yoghurt was an old aur helper.

### Features of Yay

- Perform advanced dependency solving
- Download PKGBUILDs from ABS or AUR
- Tab-complete the AUR
- Query user up-front for all input (prior to starting builds)
- Remove make dependencies at the end of the build process
- Run without sourcing PKGBUILD
